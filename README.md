# AudioMoth-Counter #
A minimal AudioMoth firmware which turns it into a binary counter.

### Usage ###

When powered on the LEDs will flash to count binary integers starting from zero. The green LED represents a binary "0", the red a binary "1". This a lightly modified version of the [example AudioMoth-Project firmware](https://github.com/OpenAcousticDevices/AudioMoth-Project) so all the usual behaviour is still there, e.g. being able to flash new firmware via USB.
